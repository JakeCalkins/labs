    <p>Hi, I'm Jake. I like UX.</p>
    <p>I am a junior at the University of Massachusetts College of Computer and Information Sciences (UMass CICS). At this point, I am 75% of the way to a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, barring any sort of life threatening disaster that forces me to become a nun.</p>
    <p>On top of being just a student, I am also a rower, designer, developer, and musician. To date, my band has released one full length album, one EP and I am almost done writing the second full length album. I play guitar, bass, and have recently aquired a drumset exclusively for the purpose of disabling my neighbors' ability to hear.</p> 
    <p>I have rowed at a competitive level for over 12 seasons, formerly for the Shrewsbury High School Crew Team and now for the UMass Men's Rowing club. My boat finished 6th and 7th nationally in the last two years, after which I was also elected onto the UMRA Executive Board as web developer and manager. It is my duty to maintain an online presence and communicate with future rowers, parents and alumni in an open, exciting and honest way</p>
